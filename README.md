## What?

We are making a tool for Age UK 'Companions' to use in wide-ranging hour-long conversations with older people, to record their situations and goals in life, prompt the Companion with useful information and prompts, and generate an action plan that can help the older person improve their whole life and independence.

## Why?

Older people don't have anyone to help them coordinate support around their overall needs and goals. They have to tell different people and organisations the same information again and again. No one helps them to improve the root causes of their difficulties or to be in control of their support.
Age UK Companions can help older people in this way but their work processes are cumbersome. It takes 1 hour to talk with an older person but then 3 hours to handle the admin, make referrals and write up the plan in multiple systems afterwards.
Age UK wants to help 500,000 a year. Currently they can only help est 125,000. If we can help increase productivity x4 with this tool then they will hit their target.

## How?

We need a tool that
Can run on any device, whether there is an internet connection or not
Has a simple interface that can be used together with an older person, with them answering some questions and looking at information and action plans
Allows fast data entry and quick visual navigation from topic to topic so that it doesn't get in the way of the natural flow of conversation
Prompts the Companion with useful suggested actions and advice so that the help and action plans we deliver are consistently good across the country.
